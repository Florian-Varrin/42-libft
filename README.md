# 42 school libft

This repository contains my version of the 42 school `libft`.

Be careful, this project is not made to pass the libft project norminette. There is additional functions and the file structure is wrong for the norminette.

To compile, do a `libft.a` binary, do:

```
make libft.a
```

This library contains `ft_get_next_line`, you can pass the buffer size by doing:

```
make BUFFER_SIZE=42 libft.a
```
Default value for `BUFFER_SIZE` is `256`
